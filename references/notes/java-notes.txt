		- default, private, protected, public
		
	- Inheritance
		- acquiring/inheriting state and behavior from parent class

Java I/O
	- An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays
	- Byte Stream -> Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes
	- Character Stream -> Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from the local character set. 
	- Buffered Stream -> Buffered input streams read data from a memory area known as a buffer; the native input API is called only when the buffer is empty. Similarly, buffered output streams write data to a buffer, and the native output API is called only when the buffer is full.
		- Flushing Buffer Stream to sync write with native file sys
	- Scanning and Formatting
	- I/O from command line
	
	- File I/O
		ByteStream 
			- FileInputStream
			- FileOutputStram
		CharacterStream
			- FileReader
			- FilerWriter
		BufferedStream
			- BufferedReader
			- BufferedWriter
			- BufferedInputStream
			- BufferedOutputStream

	- Ways to create Thread
		- Extending Thread class

			- create ExecutorService instance with ThreadPool (Fixed, Cached, SigleThread, etc..)
			- submit the instance of class implementing Callable interface
			- returns reference of Future object to refer the thread submitted
			- get the value returned by thread from Future
			- shutdown the ExecutorService
