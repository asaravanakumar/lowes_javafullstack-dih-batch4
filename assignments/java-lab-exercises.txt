EXERCISE 07: Write a Java program to compute the distance between two points on the earth's surface.

Distance between the two points [ (x1,y1) & (x2,y2)]
d = radius * arccos(sin(x1) * sin(x2) + cos(x1) * cos(x2) * cos(y1 - y2))
Radius of the earth r = 6371.01 Kilometers

Input Data:
Input the latitude of coordinate 1: 25
Input the longitude of coordinate 1: 35
Input the latitude of coordinate 2: 35.5
Input the longitude of coordinate 2: 25.5

Expected Output:

The distance between those points is: 1480.0848451069087 km
